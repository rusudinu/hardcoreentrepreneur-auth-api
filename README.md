# Unencrypted login system API

Hi! This repo is an API for the Hardcore Entrepreneur contest, that demonstrates the easiest way to create a login system API, using Spring Boot.

## Please note that:

- this is the most basic form of a login system
- nothing is encrypted in the database, and this is a huge vulnerability
- this is just a demo, DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION / APPS OUTSIDE THE CONTEST due to the fact that the passwords are not being encrypted
- in the modern days a login system is usually based on auth tokens
- whi are passwords not encrypted? for the simplicity of the demo / api
